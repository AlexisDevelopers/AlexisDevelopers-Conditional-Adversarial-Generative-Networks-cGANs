The project is about an implementation of Conditional Adverse Generative Networks (cGAN) in TensorFlow 2 to generate CIFAR-10 images, which is an image dataset consisting of 10 classes, each containing 6000 32x32 pixel images.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow 2, numpy, and matplotlib. The CIFAR-10 dataset is then loaded and one-hot encoding is performed for the outputs.

Then, the architecture of the discriminator and the generator are defined. In the discriminator, an input is added for the one-hot matrix that conditions the output, while in the generator, the one-hot matrix concatenated with the random noise input is added to condition the output of the network.

Finally, the GAN class is defined, which is the complete implementation of the conditional adversarial generative network. The training process is defined in train_step, which includes creating dummy images from the generator, concatenating the dummy images to the one-hot matrix and the real images to the one-hot matrix, feeding both through the discriminator, computing the losses and the propagation of the gradients through both networks to update the weights.

This project aims to generate realistic CIFAR-10 images using a conditional antagonistic generative network.
